<p>Ron Amadeo, writing for Android Police, think many of the design changes in the Galaxy S III — both hardware and software — were made in response to Apple’s trade dress infringement suit against Samsung:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So there you have it. A darn-near perfect explanation of the GSIII
design. Sure, it’s butt ugly, but it’s also 100% (well maybe 90%)
lawyer approved. An amorphous, unsymmetrical blob that doesn’t
come in black, with a non-permanent dock and non-square icons.
There’s no way Apple can add this design to their Samsung lawsuit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It really does look a lot less like an iPhone than previous Galaxy S models.</p>
