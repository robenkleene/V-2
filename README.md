A Markdown preview style that uses a typographic grid, a work in progress.

Based on the following influences:

- *[Grid Systems in Graphic Design](http://www.amazon.com/Systems-Graphic-Systeme-Visuele-Gestaltung/dp/3721201450/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1348952222&sr=8-1&keywords=grid+system)*
- [Robin Williams's typography books](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=ntt_athr_dp_sr_1?_encoding=UTF8&field-author=Robin%20Williams&ie=UTF8&search-alias=books&sort=relevancerank)
- Page layout in _The Economist_ and _The New Yorker_
- Mark Boulton's numerous writings on web typography, in particular the "[Five simple steps to better typography](http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/comments/five-simple-steps-to-better-typography)" series
- [Joe Clark](http://blog.fawny.org/)

Not influenced by *[The Elements of Typographic Style](http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Typographic-Style-Robert-Bringhurst/dp/0881792063/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1348952357&sr=8-1&keywords=typographic+style)*, which, while not a bad book, is impractical towards attaining typographic convention.
